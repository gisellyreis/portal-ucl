# UCL - Urban Computing Lab


<!-- The Urban Computing Lab (UCL) research group at PGCOMP/UFBA focuses on orchestrating data generated by large urban centers to facilitate and improve people's quality of life. To achieve this goal, orchestration takes place through the acquisition, integration and analysis of a large volume of data that is continuously generated by various sources, such as sensors, devices, vehicles, houses, buildings and people. In addition, data orchestration in Urban Computing uses sensing technologies and large-scale computing infrastructures (Edge and Cloud) to process machine learning methods. -->

This repository contains the code for the UCL website (https://ucl.ufba.br). The UCL is a research group at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), Brazil. Focused on the area of Urban Computing and Smart Cities.



# Importing papers from Curriculo Lattes

* Go to [Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/).
* Search for the researcher.
* Click on **Exportar em XML**.
* Save the file as **curriculo.xml** in the root folder of this repository.

The workflow script will automatically convert the XML file to JSON and update the website.

## Conversion details

1. First, the script use the [Semantic Lattes](https://github.com/urbcomp-lab/SLattes) tool to convert the Lattes XML file to [BibTeX](https://www.bibtex.org/).

2. Then, the script use the [astrocite-bibtex](https://github.com/dsifford/astrocite) tool to convert the BibTeX file to [CSL JSON](https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema).

3. Finally, we use the [seboettg/citeproc-php](https://github.com/seboettg/citeproc-php) to render the CSL JSON file to HTML.
